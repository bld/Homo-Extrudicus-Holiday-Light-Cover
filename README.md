Turn holiday lights into Halloween skull lights!

3D printable model derived from the [Homo Extrudicus found in somerset U.K.](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25348) by [flint_read](http://www.thingiverse.com/flint_read/designs).

Instructions
------------
1. Print in natural or translucent PLA
2. String mini holiday lights
4. Stick on lights - clean out with a knife if they're too tight

You don't need to print one for every light (100 on the usual string) if you don't have time. I printed 5 and spaced them ~18 inches apart.
